# Roadmap ibc-go

_Lastest update: April 6th, 2023_

This document endeavours to inform the wider IBC community about plans and priorities for work on ibc-go by the team at Interchain GmbH. It is intended to broadly inform all users of ibc-go, including developers and operators of IBC, relayer, chain and wallet applications.

This roadmap should be read as a high-level guide, rather than a commitment to schedules and deliverables. The degree of specificity is inversely proportional to the timeline. We will update this document periodically to reflect the status and plans. For the latest expected release timelines, please check [here](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/wiki/Release-timeline).

## v7.1.0

Because it is so important to have an ibc-go release compatible with the latest Cosmos SDK release, a couple of features will take a little longer and be released in [v7.1.0](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/milestone/37).

### Localhost connection

This feature will add support for applications on a chain to communicate with applications on the same chain using the existing standard interface to communicate with applications on remote chains. This is a powerful UX improvement, particularly for those users interested in interacting with multiple smart contracts on a single chain through one interface.

For more details, see the new [ICS 09 specification](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/tree/main/spec/client/ics-009-loopback-cilent).

A special shout out to Strangelove Ventures and Polymer Labs for their substantial contribution on this feature.

## v7.2.0

Follow the progress with the [milestone](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/milestone/37).

### Support for Wasm light clients

We will add support for Wasm light clients. The first Wasm client developed with ibc-go/v7 02-client refactor and stored as Wasm bytecode will be the GRANDPA light client used for Cosmos <> Substrate IBC connections. This feature will be used also for a NEAR light client in the future.

This feature was developed by Composable and Strangelove but will be upstreamed into ibc-go.

## v8.0.0

Follow the progress with the [milestone](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/milestone/38).

### Channel upgradability

Channel upgradability will allow chains to renegotiate an existing channel to take advantage of new features without having to create a new channel, thus preserving all existing packet state processed on the channel. This feature will enable, for example, the adoption on existing channels of features like [path unwinding](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/discussions/824) or fee middlware.
